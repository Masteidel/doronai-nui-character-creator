    "description": "The Prime Species are a collective of powerful and once-noble beings, each falling under a kingdom led by a single warlord, or Barraki. These kingdoms once joined to form the League of Six Kingdoms, a faction that once succeeded in conquering much of the Matoran Universe. Their efforts destabilized much of the world, and threatened to undermine the Great Spirit himself. The League’s war efforts were ultimately thwarted by the Brotherhood of Makuta in a war known as the Prosecution, with the Barraki mysteriously disappearing moments before they were to be executed. Bereft of their leaders, the Six Kingdoms fell from power, becoming mere shadows of their former selves."
