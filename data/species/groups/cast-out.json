    "description": "While the Matoran have Mata Nui's favor most of all, many other Oropi can at least claim good fortune under the Great Spirit's gaze. Not all are so lucky, however; whether through callousness from their fellow Oropi, frightening appearances, or a mutual hatred, some Oropi must eke out a living in the darker corners of the Matoran Universe, praying that they remain untouched and undisturbed. A few of these neglected beings rage against their apparent misfortune, and seek to tear down those perceived as more fortunate in a brief but powerful outcry of revenge."
