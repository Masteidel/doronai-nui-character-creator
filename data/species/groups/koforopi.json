    "description": "While the worst of the Oropi are compared to Rahi in character, some Rahi may find that comparison unflattering. \"Those who speak a little\", the Koforopi, have discovered traits within them that bring them closer to the Oropi than might be first thought. Whether a spark of uncommon intelligence, empathy drawn forth at the injustices they perceive, or wise guidance from a long-forgotten mentor, they may be heroes of legend or villains of nightmares. But always, of their own choice."
