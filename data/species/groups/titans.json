    "name": "Titans",
    "description": "These rare and powerful Species were either present at the beginning of the Matoran Universe (often actively assisting in its construction, or managing those who did), or were introduced shortly thereafter. Much of their history has melded with legends and myths, as few are left to set the record straight, either due to being deliberately reclusive or as a result of tragedies that struck them long ago. They are most commonly found in the dark, unknown regions of the world, or in small numbers as travelers and vagabonds."
