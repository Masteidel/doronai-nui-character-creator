    "description": "There are a number of additional Oropi Species that are known to exist throughout the universe, either on their own islands or intermingled with other societies. While they each have their own histories, cultures, and physical traits, they are not closely related enough to one another to have their own subsection. Consider this the catch-all grouping for Oropi who don’t fit neatly into another category."
