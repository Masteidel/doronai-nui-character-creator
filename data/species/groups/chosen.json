    "name": "Chosen of the Great Spirit",
    "description": "Of all the Species that inhabit the known universe, Matoran, Toa, and Turaga are by far the most common, the most industrious, and the most important to the will of the Great Spirit, Mata Nui. More akin to a single Species than three distinct groups, the Great Spirit’s chosen people live amongst each other in intermingled communities, and are divided into elemental Tribes, each with their own capabilities, roles to fill, and physical characteristics. Additionally, unlike most other Oropi, Matoran, Toa, and Turaga all require the use of Kanohi Masks to varying degrees."
